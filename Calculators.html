<h1 style="text-align: center">Old Calculator Museum</h1>

<p style="text-align: center">Here are some old and new calculators I have. Two of them are owned by my kids, the rest are mine. The calculators are shown in the order I acquired them.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">This TI-30 III was my first&nbsp;calculator. All&nbsp;students taking the sciences track in my high school had to buy this model as a sophomore.&nbsp;As I recall, the school puchased them in bulk and handed them out one day in class. We had to pay a modest amount, I think about $20.&nbsp;This was 1984. The original batteries (LR44 x 2) lasted&nbsp;until about 2008 when&nbsp;I replaced them because the screen was getting dim.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="Calculators/TI30III.JPG" style="border-top: 0px solid; height: 602px; border-right: 0px solid; width: 500px; border-bottom: 0px solid; border-left: 0px solid" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center">This HP-15C was a high school graduation present in 1986, and this was my favorite calculator all throughout college. I got used to the PRN entry and I liked the&nbsp;engineering notation;&nbsp;this is like scientific notation except the power of 10 is always a multiple of 3, 10^3, 10^6, 10^-3, etc.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="Calculators/HP15C.JPG" style="border-top: 0px solid; height: 345px; border-right: 0px solid; width: 500px; border-bottom: 0px solid; border-left: 0px solid" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center">I bought this TI-34 while I was in college because it had boolean logic and hexadecimal conversion. This was&nbsp;1988. I remember the day I bought it there was an ice storm, and my car slid off the road but I got traction once I got 2 wheels in&nbsp;the grass and corrected and kept going. I was fearless or foolish in those days.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&nbsp;<img src="Calculators/TI34.JPG" style="border-top: 0px solid; height: 732px; border-right: 0px solid; width: 500px; border-bottom: 0px solid; border-left: 0px solid" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center">&nbsp;I bought this HP-10B, a business calculator, because it had the ability to calculate amortization math for loans. I don&#39;t remember the exact year, but I know I was out of school and working for a&nbsp;few&nbsp;years before I bought it.&nbsp;It might have been around 1994.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="Calculators/HP10B.JPG" style="border-top: 0px solid; height: 547px; border-right: 0px solid; width: 500px; border-bottom: 0px solid; border-left: 0px solid" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center">This HP-20S is the scientific version of the 10B.&nbsp; I liked the 10B so much&nbsp;that I decided to buy his brother, the 20S just a few weeks later.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="Calculators/HP20S.JPG" style="border-top: 0px solid; height: 607px; border-right: 0px solid; width: 500px; border-bottom: 0px solid; border-left: 0px solid" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center">This TI BA II Plus was given to me by my father-in-law. I don&#39;t remember the exact year. I&#39;ll guess 2005.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="Calculators/TIBAII.JPG" style="border-top: 0px solid; height: 767px; border-right: 0px solid; width: 500px; border-bottom: 0px solid; border-left: 0px solid" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center">This Sharp EL-1611 also came from my father-in-law at the same&nbsp;time as the BA II Plus. This is my only printing calculator. When I first got it, the printing was&nbsp;good.&nbsp;By now the ribbon has continued to dry out and the printing is getting faint, but it still works.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="Calculators/SharpEL1611.JPG" style="border-top: 0px solid; height: 629px; border-right: 0px solid; width: 500px; border-bottom: 0px solid; border-left: 0px solid" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center">This TI-30X IIS (can TI find enough suffixes?) was a gift from Harris Corp.&nbsp;Supposedly, a distant relative to my 1984 TI-30III, but it is hard to see much resemblance in looks or functionality.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="Calculators/TI30XIIs.JPG" style="border-top: 0px solid; height: 645px; border-right: 0px solid; width: 500px; border-bottom: 0px solid; border-left: 0px solid" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center">This TI-34 MultiView is the calculator my son needed for&nbsp;6th grade in 2014. This doesn&#39;t bear any resemblance to my 1988 T-34 and it does not have the wonderful and unique computer math of the old&nbsp;TI-34.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="Calculators/TI34Multi.JPG" style="border-top: 0px solid; height: 690px; border-right: 0px solid; width: 500px; border-bottom: 0px solid; border-left: 0px solid" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center">This TI-nspire CX is the calculator my son needed in 8th grade for the 2016 school year.&nbsp;It starts to blur the line between a calculator and computer. It has a touchpad with onscreen&nbsp;mouse cursor, it has document storage,&nbsp;a graphical user interface, and an alpha-numeric keyboard.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="Calculators/TInspireCX.JPG" style="border-top: 0px solid; height: 803px; border-right: 0px solid; width: 500px; border-bottom: 0px solid; border-left: 0px solid" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center">This TI-34 II is a third&nbsp;varient of the TI-34 family. This was a recent donation to the museum by a friend. It looks similar in construction and capabilities to the TI-30X IIS.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="Calculators/TI34II.JPG" style="border-top: 0px solid; height: 662px; border-right: 0px solid; width: 500px; border-bottom: 0px solid; border-left: 0px solid" /></p>
