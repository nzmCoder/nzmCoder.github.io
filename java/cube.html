<p pbzloc="19">Here is a 3D cube applet written in Java. I used the Java graphics primitives drawPolygon() and fillPolygon() to draw the cube. All transformations and renderings are generated dynamically using a matrix class and point class I wrote. The hidden line removal technique is done by sorting the sides by Z coordinate and drawing the visible sides over the top of the ones below.</p>

<p pbzloc="24">The initial view will be&nbsp;a flat square.&nbsp;Press&nbsp;the Rotate buttons to see it as a 3D cube.&nbsp; The controls&nbsp;on the right can&nbsp;change the position, size, and rotation on the X, Y, and Z axes. This is an applet I wrote for an RIT class, <i>Topics in Graphics</i> in August 1996.</p>
