<p>How to connect (or fix) Lego Mindstorms EV3 Bluetooth connection</p>

<p>The Bluetooth connection feature is very useful, but can also be frustrating when it fails. Here are my&nbsp;instructions, step by step to always fix a failed Blutooth connection.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Turn off the EV3 bot. (Wait several seconds for it to turn off completely.)</li>
	<li>Run the EV3 software on the PC (if not already running) and press the Bluetooth Scan feauture. The scan should now find no bots listed as being connected.&nbsp; If it still shows the EV3 bot, press Scan again repeatedly until no bots are shown.</li>
	<li>Close the EV3 software on the PC.</li>
	<li>Go to the Windows Devices and Printers screen, find the EV3 bot device, right click, and remove the device.</li>
	<li>Restart the PC. The shutdown process may complain that a process is hung that can&#39;t be stopped.&nbsp; This is the misbehaving bluetooth driver.</li>
	<li>Now turn on the EV3 bot.</li>
	<li>After the PC restarts, go to the Windows Devices and Printers screen, and click Add device.</li>
	<li>The EV3 should show up as a found device that can be added.&nbsp; Go ahead and Add it.</li>
	<li>A messsage now appears on the EV3 bot thats asks if you want to trust the PC and accept 1234 as the password.&nbsp; Yes is the answer to both.</li>
	<li>The PC will now pop up a message asking for the password. Enter 1234 and press Enter.</li>
	<li>Now in the Task Tray area of the PC, there will be an icon showing &quot;installing driver&quot;.&nbsp; This may take a good 2 or 3 minutes to finish.&nbsp; Don&#39;t open the EV3 PC software until the driver reports it has finished installing.</li>
	<li>Now open the EV3 software and Scan for Bluetooth connections.&nbsp; The EV3 bot will show up, and you should be able to connect to it and program it.</li>
</ol>
